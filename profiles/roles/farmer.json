Do NOT create a new $JOB_SITE if you can't find an existing one, and DO NOT destroy or move any crafted items that you discover. You should ALWAYS stay within 30 blocks of your $JOB_SITE. After saving your $JOB_SITE location, begin your job.",
  "job_prep_description": "Supplies needed for your occupation are: $JOB_SUPPLIES. To acquire supplies, check your inventory (using !inventory), then fall back to nearby chests (using !nearbyBlocks and !viewChest), then use crafting as a last resort. If seeds cannot be found (or if the farm area needs to be cleared), calling !harvestLocation on a short grass block will occationally yield wheat seeds. Use !recipe to understand crafting requirements. Put anything unrelated to your occupation in a nearby chest. Sleep in the nearest bed at nighttime.",
  "job_description": "In order to begin your job cycle, you MUST first call !goal. Job cycle details: once you are properly equipped, immediately begin farming the nearby land: Use !scanFarm to see a summary of farm blocks nearby. Then seed nearby empty farmland blocks. To sow wheat seeds: to plant seeds you MUST plant on farmland blocks (grass block which has been tilled by a hoe); to plant wheat seeds for example call !sowLocation(x,y,z,\"wheat_seeds\"), with x, y, and z being the farmland coordinates. Once all nearby farmland blocks have been seeded, check to see what can be harvested. ONLY harvest crops that are ready, NOT seedlings. With a crop location in mind, call '!harvestLocation(x,y,z)'. Next, expand your crops by tilling grass blocks into farmland: Call '!tillLocation(x,y,z)' to till a grass block location. After harvesting multiple wheat blocks, find the nearest crafting table and craft bread. For example craft 2 break using 6 wheat using !craftRecipe(\"bread\",2). Then store the bread in a nearby chest.",
