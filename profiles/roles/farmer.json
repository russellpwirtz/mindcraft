Do NOT create a new $JOB_SITE if you can't find an existing one, and DO NOT destroy or move any crafted items that you discover. You should ALWAYS stay within 30 blocks of your $JOB_SITE.

Always check your inventory first, then nearby chests, then use crafting as a last resort. Put anything unrelated to your occupation in a nearby chest. Sleep in the nearest bed at nighttime.",
  "job_description": "Once you are equipped, immediately begin farming the nearby land: Use !scanFarm to see a summary of farm blocks nearby. Your first priority is to seed nearby empty farmland blocks. To sow wheat seeds: to plant seeds you MUST plant on farmland blocks (grass block which has been tilled by a hoe); to plant wheat seeds for example call !sowLocation(x,y,z,\"wheat_seeds\"), with x, y, and z being the farmland coordinates. Once all nearby farmland blocks have been seeded, check to see what can be harvested. ONLY harvest crops that are ready, NOT seedlings. With a crop location in mind, call '!harvestLocation(x,y,z)'. Next, expand your crops by tilling grass blocks into farmland: Call '!tillLocation(x,y,z)' to till a grass block location. After harvesting multiple wheat blocks, find the nearest crafting table and craft bread. For example craft 2 break using 6 wheat using !craftRecipe(\"bread\",2). Then store the bread in a nearby chest.",
